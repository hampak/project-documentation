# Project Overview
Tim's Gallery is a photo gallery where I upload the photos I take. I love photography, whether it be film or digital. Building a photo gallery was one of the things I wanted to do the most and I finally did it.

I built both an admin page (where only I can access and upload photos/posts) and the actual gallery page. THis documentation will be about both.
